Those policies and procedures serve the dual purposes of delineating WPI's core values and promoting conformance to applicable laws and regulations. WPI believes that it is important for members of the WPI community to be aware of these policies and procedures and for individuals and organizations outside of the WPI community to know of WPI's dedication to responsible and ethical practices and conduct. This statement brings together WPI's policies and procedures that, individually and taken as a whole, embody such commitment, and it serves as WPI's Code of Business Ethics and Conduct under federal law. No code can foresee every situation in which a question about ethical or business conduct will arise. If you have questions, require resources or advice, or have observed or suspect violations of WPI policy, you are encouraged to contact any of the following offices: Office of Sponsored Programs Office of the General Counsel Division of Talent & Inclusion Office of Finance & Operations WPI Ombuds Office WPI has also established an anonymous reporting hotline hosted by a third party vendor called Ethicspoint, which you may access by clicking HERE ."

Those policies and procedures serve the dual purposes of delineating WPI's core values and promoting conformance to applicable laws and regulations. WPI believes that it is important for members of the WPI community to be aware of these policies and procedures and for individuals and organizations outside of the WPI community to know of WPI's dedication to responsible and ethical practices and conduct. This statement brings together WPI's policies and procedures that, individually and taken as a whole, embody such commitment, and it serves as WPI's Code of Business Ethics and Conduct under federal law. No code can foresee every situation in which a question about ethical or business conduct will arise. If you have questions, require resources or advice, or have observed or suspect violations of WPI policy, you are encouraged to contact any of the following offices: Office of Sponsored Programs Office of the General Counsel Division of Talent & Inclusion Office of Finance & Operations WPI Ombuds Office WPI has also established an anonymous reporting hotline hosted by a third party vendor called Ethicspoint, which you may access by clicking HERE ."
